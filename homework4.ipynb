    "1. Train a SVM classifier (gamma = 0.01) with the first 10000 samples of the stream. Subsequently, evaluate it on the remaining data instances. What performance do you achieve on the train and the test set?\n",
    "* Implement a Page Hinkley change detection on the datastream. Again use the first 10000 data instances for the first model training. Retraing the model when a change is detected. How many drifts do you detect in the data? Plot the score curve\n",
    "* Perform a grid search on the whole dataset with the following paramters:  <br /> <br />  **Page-Hinkley:** lambda = [0.01, 0.05, 0.1]  <br /> **SVM:** svm_gamma = [0.01, 0.1, 1]  <br /> <br /> Use the first 10000 samples for the initial training and then a batch-size of 1000 samples for iterative evaluation. Print the prediction accuracy for each parameter pair. What is the best parameter pair? *Hint: You have to implement GridSearch manually.*"
